**THIS IS A WIP AND ISN'T SUITABLE FOR USE JUST YET.**

But hey if you wanna have a try, go ahead!


Usage:
* navigate to folder with `obj`,`mtl` and all texture files
* `lua main.lua Your_OBJ_File.obj`
* The output will be the same name as your input file name as a C header filetype

That's it! I'll add more to this when it's totally finished!

Limitations:
* **Textures MUST be BITMAP files**
* currently only works well with 32x32bit MAX bitmaps
* can only handle a single mesh
* cannot have more than 30 vertices at the moment (planning to fix this tomorrow!)
